 # Loan Prediction System - Machine Learning Model

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Loan Prediction System** built using **Machine Learning** in Google Colab. The model predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant details using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of loan application dataset
- Training and testing using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- Visualization using **Seaborn**
- Evaluation using **accuracy score**
- Lightweight and efficient model

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following attributes:
- **Gender**: Male/Female
- **Married**: Marital status
- **Dependents**: Number of dependents
- **Education**: Applicant’s education level
- **Self_Employed**: Employment status
- **ApplicantIncome**: Applicant’s income
- **CoapplicantIncome**: Co-applicant’s income
- **LoanAmount**: Loan amount requested
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Term of loan in months
- **Credit_History**: Applicant's credit history (1 = Good, 0 = Bad)
- **Property_Area**: Urban, Semiurban, or Rural

The dataset can be obtained from publicly available sources such as Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 📜 Libraries Used
The model is implemented using the following libraries:
- **numpy**: Numerical computations
- **pandas**: Data handling and manipulation
- **seaborn**: Data visualization
- **train_test_split**: Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: Classification model
- **accuracy_score**: Evaluating model performance

## 📊 Model Performance
The model is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as:
- Accuracy:0.8333333333333334%
